Version 1.0.4.0 Big Update.
******Important ******
1:27 PM 9/10/2011  - Because I have changed the way the Statistics are stored the profile.ini 
structure has changed I recomend deleting the "weapon profiles" folder and then unziping weapon_profiles.zip located in Hunter Stats logger folder and placing them 
in place of "weapons profile" folder. Then restart Hunter Stats Logger.

Or if you prefer refill out your info per weapon you use.
Note: If "Weapon Stats:" location is left blank it will default on exit to "statistics\[Item type]\History [Item Name].ini"
